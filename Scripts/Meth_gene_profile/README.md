Meth_gene_profile_pipeline.sh, contains the main pipeline used to create the main gene profile dataset

Gene_profile*.R scripts where used to create .RData-files that I later visualized using Collage_plots.R and DE_prom_GB_stats_and_plots.R. 

To run the Gene_profile*.R scripts in parallel I used the methgp*.sh scripts.

N.B. not all Gene_profile*.R or all  the plots in Collage_plots.R and DE_prom_GB_stats_and_plots.R, where used in the manuscript, but can be useful for others and was useful in the data exploration process.
